But in order to be accountable, one should understand the various roles, responsibilities and processes that govern the environment.  Without this basic information sorted out, there are gray areas of ownership, overlapping task owners and inefficient execution within projects.  As they say, when everyone is responsible then no ONE is responsible and the notion of accountability suffers.    To address these issues, there is a process known as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). This process is an important tool for all of us to use in driving greater role and process clarity - and thus greater Accountability.  This assessment process has been piloted in the North America Multi-Media Integration team in 2009 with great results.    We should all become familiar with this process and begin utilizing it to drive greater clarity in support of achieving our collective goal of greater accountability within our teams.  This webinar on the CMMI approach has been developed to provide an overview of the approach and an example of how to use it within your own teams.          Audience: All employees interested in process improvement.','KILGORE, Doug','KILGORE, Doug','2015-12-29 02:26:00','0','2017-02-03 18:23:30')

Thankfully there are many proven project management processes designed to direct, monitor, and control project work. For example, project baselines for schedule, cost, scope, and quality give the project manager a firm foundation by which to monitor project work and make decisions. When problems arise, strategies for managing changes help get the project back in line. This course will equip project managers with skills to manage change in an integrated fashion so that, for example, changes to scope are reflected appropriately in the quality, schedule, and cost baselines. The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area includes six processes, ranging from the creation of the project charter at the beginning of a project through to the close of a project or phase. This course covers the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the third and fourth processes: Direct and Manage Project Work and Monitor and Control Project Work. Through interactive learning strategies and realistic scenarios, you will explore these concepts and gain a better understanding of the project integration processes in action.   This course will assist in preparing learners for the PMI® certification exam.

Recent trends indicate that DDoS attacks are not only increasing in scale and bandwidth, they are also growing in sophistication as they single out specific back-end vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure. These new threats, coupled with reductions in IT budgets and qualified security personnel, are making it harder for CIOs to secure their networks. Service providers are starting to address this gap by offering new, cloud-based threat mitigation services to augment the home-grown security solutions already deployed by enterprises. To address this opportunity we have partnered with Arbor networks and are integrating their Threat Management System (TMS) into our carrier-class Service Routers.    Objectives:  Familiarize sales with the DDoS protection marketplace, its challenges and opportunities, and what the Service Router brings to the table - in conjunction with Arbor Networks - to address them. Ensure sales understands how this new capability can help drive incremental sales from existing SR deployments and how it can help us distill unique value propositions in competitive edge and core router bids.   Course Outline:  -       Summarize the evolution of DDoS attacks over the last 6 years, -       Summarize their impact to enterprises and service provider networks.  -       Outline product evolution trends leading to our joint solution with Arbor -       Illustrate how our MS-ISA TMS and Arbor Peakflow allows SPs to protect their service infrastructure from DDoS attacks while enabling new service revenue -       Summarize benefits to SPs, their enterprise customers, and to ALU -       Review competitive differentiators  Audience: Sales  Expected Knowledge: None','SCHYMANSKI, Jeff','SCHYMANSKI, Jeff','2015-12-29 02:26:00','0','2017-02-03 18:21:53')

If I decide to take it after August 31, how should I study?  Will the test change again?   The presentation will be limited to about 30 minutes so that we can have a robust conversation following what is known about the exam change and the strategies you can take to deal with this change.

The following domains are distinguished for parameter tuning: • Coverage • Accessibility • Retainability • Throughput • Latency • Mobility • Capacity Due to the wide scope of mobility, the parameters impacting mobility have further been divided into: • LTE - LTE mobility • LTE - UMTS mobility • LTE - GSM mobility • LTE - HRPD mobility Within each volume the indicators and parameters are ordered by the most important and relevant for optimization activities.  A recommended value is associated for each parameter.  The impact of the increase/decrease of the parameter value on the associated QoS Indicators is provided.  The impact of a parameter modification on the other domains is also provided (for instance the coverage will be increased but the throughput may be lowered). For each domain, several exercises are proposed with data from the field. The student is asked to improve a degraded QoS (KPI) by tuning a set of parameters.  The effect on the KPI of different sets of parameters is shown with visual bar graphs. Real situations coming from drive tests or NPO optimization are provided as illustrations. The goal of this course is to teach a method of optimization rather than a list of static rules for parameter setting which would not match every network design in a multi-technology environment.  Objectives By the end of the course, participants will be able to:  select the relevant KPI indicators related to the domain: coverage, access, retainability, throughput, latency, mobility, capacity  analyse these KPI indicators to be able to detect a bad QoS  select the parameters having an effect on the KPI indicators showing a bad QoS  tune in the right way the parameters  measure the impact of the parameter tuning on the other optimization domains  Content  Section 1: 9400 LTE RF Optimization  introduction  coverage  accessibility  retainability  throughput  latency  mobility  capacity   Audience: This course is for Radio optimization, Quality of Service and Radio traffic engineering teams.

Passion Leads To Opportunities - It is important to have a passion for your area  of business, because deep knowledge and a high level of motivation are more  likely to lead to identifying successful new business opportunities in your  chosen marketplace.      Course Objectives  Watch the video and learn something about Leadership.  　  Course Contents  Part 1 :  Leaders should infect the workforce with their energy to help an organization to  achieve and generate enthusiasm in the process.  Passion can jump-start ideas and action in the way that a decent education and  an analytical mind can''t.  Passion can be learnt by reflecting and recreating what inspires you.  Mastering your own emotions can help empower you and those around you.  Being passionate and energetic in your work is not simply a case of having bold  thoughts and a great mind; you have to be able to ''add value'' to produce  something exceptional.    Part 2 :  Passion is vital to business success. If leaders don''t have passion for the  business they are going into, they shouldn''t go into it.  Head knowledge of a business, and the seeming certainty that it will be  financially successful, are not reasons to go into a business. These won''t  sustain you, and you will end up failing.  Passion helps leaders see opportunities that others don''t see. Passion helps  leaders understand exactly how their business can be successful; it helps them  see the gaps in the marketplace that they can fill.  It pays not to go into a business, or look at a business, the way everyone else  does. With this approach, leaders will miss the opportunities that are unique to  them. Rather, leaders should look at their business for themselves.    Audience:  Managers and subordinates','CAI, Songwei','CAI, Songwei','2015-12-29 02:26:00','0','2017-02-03 18:23:34')

Therefore customer’s transmission routes must be equipped according to the requirements  with regard to transmission quality and availability. The base for it is a Wide Area Network based on  IP/MPLS that contains Alcatel-Lucent 7750 Service Routers and Alcatel-Lucent 7450 Ethernet Service  Switches. These products have IP-abilities to offer Layer 2 or Layer 3 services. E-Line and E-LAN  services are nowadays the network architectures which are introduced. - The participants are able to understand Ethernet protocols and the TCP/IP protocol family. They  learn Ethernet Protocols key functions and the interaction of the different routing protocols and  MPLS, to implement the different services through routed packet networks.  - The basics are deepened by practical exercises on the demo network containing 7750 SR Routers.  By tracing and analyzing of data packets between the routers the understanding and the  cooperation of the different network protocols is clarified.  - With the help of the software analyzer "Wireshark" the different protocol levels can be analyzed in  detail.

Moreover, the essential added-value of the assessment is to bring an opportunity to detect and solve a misunderstanding issue in a critical task execution.  Method After the practical course begins the assessment phase in which the trainee has to perform a selection of key exercises already seen during the course with the help of the :  Electronic Customer Documentation  Connection to 9100 BTS, 9130 BSC/MFS, 9125 TC, 9153 OMC-R, and/or 9959 NPO.  Trainee''s personal notes  The "examiner" monitors the trainee during the practical session. At the end of the assessment, a report is made to the trainee and if requested to the customer. In this report, tasks acquired and tasks not acquired will be clearly identified.   Note: assessment duration can be customized according to the number of equipments to do assessments on.

This has changed. TDD support will now be delivered as part of an LE3.0 Maintenance Release. This is only a change in the name and all other information delivered and/or provided in the session, including milestones for TDD, remain valid.   Following this Sales Training session, if you have any questions about this ‘name change’, please contact Michel Basset at michel.basset@Alcatel-Lucent.com  Release LE3.x is the second commercial release of the Alcatel-Lucent End-to-End 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) Solution. It targets a global market reach and increases the end-to-end-value of our LTE solution. Previously, Release LE2.x targeted first commercial launches with essential features to start deploying and managing high-speed data-centric networks operating in a few high-priority frequency bands. Release LE3.x provides support for LTE nomadic subscribers of high-quality voice (i.e. the end-to-end LTE dynamic Quality of Service), additional frequency bands, and Time Division-LTE (TD-LTE), as well as enhanced interworking with legacy technologies. Beyond meeting the needs of contracted customers (essentially, Verizon Wireless and AT&T), it also brings additional functionalities to speed creation, delivery, and billing of new IP multimedia applications and services, plus it addresses new market segments (e.g., public safety) for our customers.    Objectives:  This session focuses on educating our Sales Teams on our End-to-end 4G LTE Solution value proposition, providing them with information and resources to help them sell the Solution.2011 will be a critical year to extend our LTE footprint in Europe and to APAC after our big LTE wins in North America. This session will update our teams on recent products/solutions improvements and new features that contribute to reinforce the value proposition of our end-to-end 4G LTE Solution, and that they can leverage to win new LTE contracts this year.   Course Content:  The presentation will give an overview of: 1-     Our vision and strategy for LTE 2-     Our end-to-end 4G LTE Solution value proposition with Release LE3.x 3-     Our leadership in LTE, both in terms of technical and market leadership.

Both have received enormous attention and unfortunately are surrounded by much confusion.   SDN offers a solution to an important problem your customers are now facing in the data center: The network and the applications are operating in silos.  Any automated attempt by the network or the application controllers, such as the hypervisor, to improve resource utilization can only achieve a suboptimal result.  What is needed is a complete end-to-end coordinated virtual architecture enabling applications and the network to collaborate in providing a high quality experience for users and enable optimization of resource consumption.   For any solution to be successful within the enterprise data center it must address the network size as well as the existing desirable network properties that should be maintained. Benefiting from the positive aspects of an SDN network requires a clear strategy for both the application and network infrastructure.   Attend this webinar to gain a better understanding of SDN and Alcatel-Lucent''s strategy for SDN to optimize network performance with real-time applications and cloud services.

IPTV, with it''s per subscriber knowledge, interaction capability and end-to-end IP technology, has the capability to do this and change the TV experience.  The evolution of IPTV services will result in the delivery of vast quantities of video content over the triple play network. This, in turn, will lead to a radical and fundamental change in how the infrastructure delivers services driven by the need to reduce network costs, deliver the highest levels of QoE and create value with new services.  The Alcatel-Lucent Triple Play Service Delivery Architecture (TPSDA) is a purpose-built network foundation that is perfectly positioned to lead this networking evolution. The TPSDA video strategy is based on creating value through an enhanced end-user experience while enabling better monetization of the infrastructure and optimizing the IPTV network to significantly reduce costs for the operator. This is achieved by integrating video application layer functionality within the TPSDA network elements. The first phase of the video strategy, and the focus of this Hot Topic, centres on Assured Linear TV Delivery.

But if you''re not a trained writer, how do you begin? The writing process actually starts before you pick up a pen or place your fingers on a keyboard. It begins with defining what you are writing, for whom you are writing, why you are writing, and which writing approach to use. "Writing with Intention" addresses these defining matters, which you need to consider every time you sit down to write. The course includes lessons on how to link your writing to its purpose, how to modify your writing for different readers and audiences, and how to approach your content in a manner that supports the message type. In this course, business writing is taught as a collection of easy skill sets, not as a strained creative exercise. The lessons flexibly encompass almost any kind of business writing you may be required to perform on the job. No matter what your level of writing skill, if you write at work, you can benefit from this practical writing course. Know Your Audiencerecognize the value of identifying your reading audience before you start writing.indicate which reader characteristics you should know before starting to write.select methods for personalizing your business writing for your readers.associate reader roles with appropriate writing tones.apply the appropriate writing tone to a designated reader role in a business document writing scenario.

GETTING STARTED / ADMINISTRATION   The AWS allows monitoring his global status and his  processes, start/stop the entire AWS or one of his  processes.   B. NAVIGATON AND INDICATORS   On the bases of exercises the trainee gets an  overview on what the different graphical views are of  an ASAM and where to find which kind of  information.   C. STARTING FROM SCRATCH     1. Getting the ASAM Supervised   The AWS can only access the ASAM once IP  connectivity has been established between the  AWS and the ASAM. In the ASAM the IP setting  must be configured in the ASAM via the CLI. The  different possible scenarios are explained and  the trainee must be able to get his own ASAM  supervised and provision the ASAM  (subrack/board...)     2. Provisioning services to ADSL subscribers.  - Provisioning of the ADSL line include the use of  profiles. The meaning of the different profiles is  shown and experienced via dedicated  exercises.    Why profiles? What do profiles do? Where to  create profiles? How are the handled in the  AWS 5523? Where do we configure the ADSL  line? How is it done?   - Once the line is configured a connection must  be put on the line. The trainee gets his line up  and running and understands the reason why  in certain cases the AWS refuses to create  connections on a specific line.     3 Mass deployment   In this chapter the trainee learns how to create a  PVC template, get an understanding why this  can be useful and how his PVC template has to  be applied on the port.     4 Port Status   What is a port status?  How is it represented on  the screen? How do you influence it? Which are  the typical state transitions? Which are the  transitions that are not allowed by the system?

We start provisioning an xDSL line by using xDSL profiles.  We explain why these profiles are used and where to create them (profiles at NE or templates at AMS). Once the line is configured we might need an ATM termination point before we can set up the interworking function (bridge port).  For VDSL2 ports, there’s no ATM involved, but a bridge port needs to be configured anyhow. The trainee will understand the different possible ports available in the ISAM and where to find which kind of information. What is a port status? How is it represented? How do you influence it? Through dedicated exercises, using AMS and/or CLI, you will put this all into practice.  Audience: This is an operator course. Trainees will learn how to perform a basic xDSL configuration using CLI and AMS.  Expected Knowledge: The trainee must have a basic knowledge of ADSL and DSL flavours, Ethernet & IP basics, and have followed course module TAC2046 or TAC2047.

In this episode we''re going to dive deep into the Observer pattern.    The first thing we''ll do is derive the pattern from first principles. We''ll begin with a simple real-time clock application and, step by step, apply one design principle after another until the Observer pattern emerges.    Well, actually, what emerges is a structure that our current most popular languages can''t implement, because it requires multiple inheritance. So we''ll explore the workarounds to that, and then we''ll rant about why Java and C# don''t have this useful feature.    The Observer pattern comes in two forms. The "Push" model, and the "Pull" model. We''ll describe them both and discuss when and where each is appropriate.    Then we''ll turn to the larger pattern that the Observer fits into: Model View Controller. We''ll look at the history of MVC, and the unfortunate corruption of the pattern by current web frameworks.    Finally, we''ll invoke the Humble Object pattern for testing GUIs, and we''ll derive the Model View Presenter pattern from MVC.','EDGETON, Frank','EDGETON, Frank','2017-01-27 13:27:00','0','2017-02-03 18:17:10')

Therefore, a reduction in cooling costs can substantially reduce energy expenses.    As service providers and other organizations take steps to ensure competitiveness in a challenging market, many are examining new approaches to data center cooling technology.  Current heat exchange methods for cooling data centers are inherently inefficient in meeting the requirements imposed by today’s dense, high-speed computing equipment, and they can contribute considerable expense as well. By implementing a solution that aligns with a range of business initiatives — including cost-effective operation, optimization of energy efficiencies, reduced management complexity, and the need to meet green computing initiatives — service providers can address these challenges and extend their competitive advantage.   Session Objectives –Learn Key Market Drivers for Modular Cooling SolutionLearn details of Data Center Cooling StrategiesCompare ALU vs Competitors in positioning Modular Cooling SolutionPosition Modular Cooling Solution with our customers and answer key customer concerns   Session ContentData Center Challenges: : Inefficient cooling, space utilization, troubled  “hot spots”, Data Center Options: Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC), Water cooling, In-Row CoolingALU Differentiators – New Approach to Cooling known as “phase change” or “two phase” coolingBusiness case examplesHow to engage customers and sell the solution  Audience: Bids and Proposals, Business Development, Solution Architecture, Delivery, Sales, and the Regions  Expected Knowledge: None','SCHYMANSKI, Jeff','SCHYMANSKI, Jeff','2015-12-29 02:26:00','0','2017-02-03 18:21:51')

Most of these computer systems interact with the users using a GUI (Graphical User Interface) like Microsoft Windows on PCs, MAC OS on Apple computers and KDE on SUN Solaris machines. What most users don''t know is that underneath the GUI lies the world of command shells in which the communication with the computer is character based. You have to type commands and interpret the results in a totally different manner as with a GUI. Though a GUI may be the preferred way to interact with a computer it is not always possible to have one available. For example in systems that need to be installed with software and configured before the GUI can be started. This is very common in the field of telecommunications. Also using commands is much more powerful and flexible as compared to the using a GUI. During the workshop you will work in groups of ideally 2 individuals. The instructor will provide an overview of each exercise. Emphasis is on doing the work yourself. The instructor''s role is to act as a coach. The instructor will take part in individual and/or group discussions, and will emphasize on key concepts that are encountered while going through the exercises. You are encouraged to share any expertise you may have on UNIX/LINUX with your fellow students.  This workshop has been designed for you to get familiar with the basics of the Operating Systems UNIX and LINUX. After completing this workshop you should be able to: navigate through the UNIX/LINUX file system use basic UNIX/LINUX commands use the editors ed and vi create a simple script search the UNIX/LINUX file system use different shells view and modify environment variables add, modify and delete a user account packing and unpacking files (zipping) connect to other systems over a network using telnet and ftp  Audience: People who need practical knowledge on Unix/Linux&  Expected Knowledge: For this workshop you are required to have basic computer knowledge and skills. No knowledge and/or skills is required, and expected, on UNIX/LINUX.  Equipment: The course requires access to a system that is running the LINUX operating system. That could be an Intel based PC or a SUN system running the Solaris operating system. This course is based on Suse 10.2 LINUX running on an Intel based PC. Though the operating systems provide a nice GUI like KDE, the exercises will be done using a character based console shell. For looking up of the required information you need to have access to a computer with internet access.','SCAMBLER, John','SCAMBLER, John','2015-12-27 23:48:00','0','2017-02-03 18:25:38')

That person who grates our nerves, makes us cringe, and infuriates our sense of work-place ethics and decorum. They rant; they blame; they hide; they lie. It seems sometimes as if they make it their duty to make our lives miserable, but what can we do to protect ourselves from the mayhem they cause? What actions and strategies can we employ to harness their personalities and encourage their strengths? This simulation will help you practice just those skills.You have just been appointed as Project Manager for creating your product''s Version 2.0. You are taking over these duties from another manager who is being reassigned. As you will soon find out, the project is severely behind schedule and the holiday release date is threatened. Your team members represent all departments involved in the project and consequently, many different types of personalities. Your job is to get recommended solutions and prepare a presentation of those suggestions. However, just asking what they think will not be enough to compile the data you need. You must modify your tactics for each individual to ensure your success.The simulation is based on the SkillSoft series Managing and Working with Difficult People and contains links to the following SkillSoft courses: COMM0161, COMM0162, COMM0163, and COMM0164.

As Voice over IP (VoIP) and the use of softswitches becomes more common, new functions are required to meet service provider requirements. This course introduces the new network elements and capabilities that are being defined and deployed as an extension and evolution of the traditional softswitch. Networks and softswitches are connecting with each other, resulting in the need to monitor and protect traffic that crosses between them. Lesson One explains how Session Border Controllers are used to protect the network, provide interworking between different standards, and support administrative and management functions, including legal intercept. Lesson Two defines how an Application Server can be used to introduce new services, and how Media Servers can be deployed in different ways to support media interaction with users. A basic understanding of the softswitch architecture and protocols on the part of the student is required.  Audience: Telecommunications professionals who need to understand network elements and capabilities that are being defined and deployed as an extension and evolution of the traditional Softswitch.

In this episode we''re going to dive deep into the Observer pattern.    The first thing we''ll do is derive the pattern from first principles. We''ll begin with a simple real-time clock application and, step by step, apply one design principle after another until the Observer pattern emerges.    Well, actually, what emerges is a structure that our current most popular languages can''t implement, because it requires multiple inheritance. So we''ll explore the workarounds to that, and then we''ll rant about why Java and C# don''t have this useful feature.    The Observer pattern comes in two forms. The "Push" model, and the "Pull" model. We''ll describe them both and discuss when and where each is appropriate.    Then we''ll turn to the larger pattern that the Observer fits into: Model View Controller. We''ll look at the history of MVC, and the unfortunate corruption of the pattern by current web frameworks.    Finally, we''ll invoke the Humble Object pattern for testing GUIs, and we''ll derive the Model View Presenter pattern from MVC.','EDGETON, Frank','EDGETON, Frank','2017-01-27 13:30:00','0','2017-02-03 18:17:10')

This is a quote by Henri Bergson, a nineteenth century French philosopher. Since the nineteenth century, the pace of change in all aspects of our lives has become faster and faster and responding to change well is a necessity in today''s competitive business environment. Leaders and managers, regardless of industry or organisation, require a clear understanding of how important organisational change is in order to push their organisations forward. This course outlines what is meant by change, as well as the importance and benefits of implementing change within an organisation. It also details the three different types of organisational change: strategic adjustments, strategic reorientation and transformational change. Finally, this course covers different practical approaches for managing organisational change. It takes into account factors, such as the time allotted for the change, the expected degree of change and the potential resistance to change within the organisation.','KILGORE, Doug','Admin, NokiaEDU','2017-02-03 02:22:00','0','2017-02-03 18:16:58')

The air interface has been changed from a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based system to a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) based air interface. This change was required to achieve the data rate of 2 Mbps to the mobile which is a 3G requirement.  This course provides the details of the UMTS W-CDMA air interface, known as UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA). The W-CDMA physical layer is key to achieving higher data rates and supporting new features. This course provides an overview of the physical layer. In addition, power control and soft handover, important features of any CDMA air interface, are discussed.

Don''t get  pigeonholed, continually look to expand your capabilities, and don''t allow  yourself to become stagnant.  Course Objectives  Watch the video and learn something about Leadership.  　  Course Contents   Part 1 :    Individuals need to pay attention to their instincts, because if something feels  out of place for them, it''s likely that others are having similar feelings.    When these moments surface, it''s important to recognize them and take action,  especially when it has an impact on one''s ability to learn.    When a presentation or other situation doesn''t meet an individuals needs, that  person should take charge of their learning and request changes as quickly as  they identify a problem.    By taking a pull approach to education - instead of a push approach -  individuals are more likely to be engaged in their process and, ultimately, to  learn what it is they need to learn.    Part 2 :    Treat each job that you are in as a valuable learning experience.    Focus on your current job and do that to the best of your abilities; the future  will take care of itself.    None of us knows what the future has in store, so concentrate on becoming as  experienced as you can in the present.    Optimize every opportunity in your current role.  　   Audience: Managers and subordinates','CAI, Songwei','CAI, Songwei','2015-12-29 02:26:00','0','2017-02-03 18:23:34')

Dit geeft als het  ware een ‘handleiding’ in omgang met andere mensen, zowel op vlak van motiveren, communiceren,  leidinggeven, onderhandelen, tijdsbesteding, conflicthantering,....   - meer zelfinzicht: inzicht in eigen drijfveren, automatische gedragspatronen, manier van samenwerken  met anderen, reacties op stress. Inzicht is de eerste stap in het groeiproces om eventuele ongewenste  gedragspatronen te doorbreken.  - meer begrip voor andere personen, die vanuit hun eigen type heel anders kunnen reageren en handelen  dan we zelf doen.  - met behulp van de ontwikkelingsniveaus binnen het Enneagram, zie je een duidelijk persoonlijk  ontwikkelingspad voor ogen; hoe je ‘beste’ zelf eruit kan zien.     Course content     Het Enneagram is een neutraal, psychologisch model dat negen basistypen op vlak van persoonlijkheid  beschrijft. Ondanks de algemeenheden van deze negen typen is er dankzij de diepgang van het model  voldoende ruimte voor het unieke van ieder individu. Het model ontleent zijn kracht vooral aan de  diepgaande beschrijving van de drijfveren, de automatische gedragspatronen van de typen en de  ontwikkelingsniveaus binnen de typen. Door een groeiend zelfinzicht kun je anderen beter begrijpen,  verbetert je samenwerking met anderen, ben je in staat tot effectiever leidinggeven, coachen,  adviseren, begeleiden en het oplossen van conflicten. Ook naar partnerrelaties en het opvoeden van  kinderen toe biedt dit model inzichten.   Avond 1: kennismaking met het Enneagram.  - Algemene inleiding: het Enneagram als model  - Voorstelling van de typen: meest typische kenmerken per type            3FL04706AAAAWPZZAEd02      All Rights Reserved © 2007 by Alcatel-Lucent  Avond 2: verdieping in de types  - Korte herhaling van de verschillende types.   - De verdedigingsmechanismen: hoe houden de typen hun zelfbeeld in stand?  - Pijlbewegingen: hoe reageren de types onder stress en in ontspanning?  - Onbewuste, diepgaande drijfveren per type (basisangst, sociale rol, mentale fixatie en passie)  - Ontwikkelingstips per type.     Avond 3: Kernkwadranten en het Enneagram.   - Hoe zijn deze twee systemen gelinkt?   - Wat zijn de typische allergieën, kwaliteiten, valkuilen en uitdagingen per type?  - Interactieve wrap-up. Wat heeft het Enneagram hen geleerd over zichzelf, over anderen, naar  samenwerking toe?      Audience:         Expected Knowledge:   Openheid om met anderen jouw ervaringen, belevingen vanuit je eigen type te bespreken.  Via de site http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/nl/testbatterij.asp kan je een korte test doen om een  idee te krijgen van je mogelijke type.

These applications are created by a community of 14 million developers. However, today’s application development is hampered by a highly complex and fragmented industry: thousands of devices, hundreds of networks and a continually growing choice of app stores make it difficult for developers. As a result, developers typically focus on a narrow segment, for example apps for the iPhone only. Likewise, service providers are left out of the game, and are more and more becoming bit-pipe providers.   To bridge this gap, Alcatel-Lucent is transforming the telecommunications network into an application-development platform. The objective is to create an environment that entices developer engagement with service providers and enterprises to provide richer, smarter, network applications for the broadest possible consumer audience. This new, collaborative approach is supported by addressing key industry technical and business-related trouble spots and by providing the tools needed to:Expose and leverage service providers’ network capabilities, such as communication, content and network Quality of Service (QoS)Meet the full range of developer and service-provider requirements for building, testing, managing and distributing their applications   Objectives: At the end of this session, you will be able to:Describe the strategy implementedExplain the impact on the Application Enablement portfolioDescribe the Alcatel-Lucent Open API Platform  Course Content:  This Hot Topic:Elaborates on the step-by-step strategy that we have implemented Elaborates on the impact of this strategy on our Application Enablement portfolioPre-announces the Alcatel-Lucent Open API Platform, a complete modular solution set that addresses the needs of both developers and service providers  Audience: Sales  Expected Knowledge: None','SCHYMANSKI, Jeff','SCHYMANSKI, Jeff','2015-12-29 02:26:00','0','2017-02-03 18:21:51')

It is designed to build on existing capabilities, and to hone knowledge and skills in the following key areas: Understanding your customer’s business Needs-based selling Building rapport to gain trust Managing customer relationships Navigating complex buyer roles Influencing buying criteria Accelerating the buying process Strategic account planning   These objectives are integrated into a customer-centric view of the buying process. The program also reflects the changing role of direct salespeople in a world where product differentiation is becoming more difficult and customers are increasingly turning to the Internet rather than salespeople for information on features and benefits.   Creating Customer Value was developed in a unique collaboration between Imparta and Neil Rackham, the author of SPIN® Selling and a leading researcher into sales effectiveness. In particular, this program reflects much of Neil''s recent work with McKinsey and the book, ''Rethinking the Salesforce'', which he co-wrote with John de Vincentis.   The Creating Customer Value program concentrates on consultative selling - that space where salespeople first help their customers understand their problems, issues and opportunities in a new or different way and then show them new or better solutions which closely match their needs.   Objectives At the end of this program, you will be able to: • Understand the customer''s business from the customer''s perspective  • Develop strategies for improving customer perceptions of Lucent solutions • Manage all aspects of customer relationships by skillfully navigating complex buyer roles • Identify and take steps to neutralize Strategic, Tactical, Political and Individual risk that threatens the sale • Influence buying criteria and accelerate the buying process • Use strategic account planning to leverage Lucent strengths and maximize opportunities   Course Content  IntroductionAwareness of NeedsAssessment of AlternativesAlleviation of RiskAchievments of Results    Audience: Sales  Expected Knowledge: None','KILGORE, Doug','KILGORE, Doug','2015-12-27 23:48:00','0','2017-02-03 18:19:06')

Understand the commonalities with other SR-OS routers in Alcatel-Lucent’s portfolio.  A new era of core routers was needed that could better scale, be more versatile and efficient. That is why Alcatel-Lucent has developed a new range of core routers.   The 7950 XRS-20 is the new core router in the SR-OS product portfolio of Alcatel-Lucent. The Alcatel-Lucent 7950 Extensible Routing System or XRS-20 core router delivers scale, efficiency and versatility on a single platform without sacrificing flexibility. This enables service providers to meet core routing, MPLS switching, data center interconnection and infrastructure service needs in metro cores and IP backbones.   This web-based course explains the evolution of core routing and the need for a new range of core routers. The evolution is given from a traditional network to today’s and tomorrow’s networks. The need for 100Gbps interfaces and the need for the 400Gbps FP3 processors in the 7950 XRS-20 product are covered.   The 7950 XRS-20 is part of the SR-OS product family and this course shows were this core router is positioned together with the other SR-OS routers in the network. It also illustrates how this router is integrated with the existing SAM network management platform.   A dedicated section is included in this course explaining the hardware modules of the 7950 XRS-20. Each card function and the interworking between each other are explained in detail. This course shows the interface options found on the different XMAs or XRS-20 media adaptors.   The last module of the course describes the software and resiliency options of the 7950 XRS-20. The 7950 XRS-20 and 7750 family share a single OS to guarantee a common model with hardened reliability.     Course Outline:   Module 1: The evolution of core routing Module 2: Introducing the 7950 XRS-20 Module 3: The 7950 XRS-20 Overview Module 4: Software and resiliency    Audience: This course is intended for anyone who needs a basic understanding of Alcatel-Lucent’s new 7950 Extensible Routing System (7950 XRS-20).

Treat People As Equals-The temptation in senior management can sometimes be to  throw your weight around. But everyone deserves to be treated equally, and you  should treat others as you would like to be treated yourself: you never know  where you might meet them again.      Course Objectives  Watch the video and learn something about Leadership.  　  Course Contents  Part 1 :  It is important for leaders to recognize how hard their teams work for them.  One of the roles of the good leader is to repay this hard work by serving their  teams.  As a leader it is crucial to stay grounded by keeping in touch with employees  and putting yourself in their shoes.  Everyone brings their own strengths from different corporate environments,  corporate cultures, ethnic backgrounds, nationalities and cultural heritages to  an organization. It is a leader''s job to leverage this unique culture to create  real value for the business.    Part 2 :  Treating people as equals is an invaluable practise for any leader. So treat all  of your colleagues with respect, whether they are the Chairman or the cleaner.  As a leader, foster an environment where this behavior is second nature to all  employees. Do this by leading by example.  Employees remember considerate managers and will reward this with loyalty and  increased performance.  You never know where you might meet someone again in your career, so treating  people with respect is just good common sense too.

The solution is all about ensuring service continuity from outdoor to indoor environments by delivering better in-building coverage, optimizing QoS, increasing capacity and providing seamless service experience in fixed, nomadic or mobile usages for end-users.  Among multiple solutions, the Small Cells are going to change the picture completely. Acting as wireless access nodes using licensed spectrum, they offer area-specific coverage, therefore serving a smaller number of users than macro cells.  Being residential, as well as corporate or public areas, they bring new ecosystem challenges. There is a range of new stakeholders that operators need to work with. Small Cells vendors are one but also application developers, or additional stakeholders including content providers and media agencies.  Small cells are now a reality. We are currently evolving our portfolio from a "Product Attached Services" to "Small Cells as a Service".  The network needs to be built differently. Interaction between Small cells and Macro cells is a key factor, and we must provide a high level of services, in order to deal with it (Customized Indoor and Outdoor Design Capability, Macro offload Strategy, Capacity Management). We use specific tools for designing In-Building Solutions. These are now combined with outdoor macro network tools in order to optimize the end to end Solution and then ensure a global QoS. Co-operation with Bell Labs is here a critical differentiator.   Adding a new network means obviously new challenges in terms of IT Integration, Application Integration (through API and OAP platform) as well as supporting our customer with a comprehensive set of consulting services.   This is the way of connecting all of these islands of life, developing a seamless network, ensuring continuity of Service and supporting bandwidth hungry end users applications.   This webinar will cover the following topics: • An overview of In-Building Continuity Solution • Small Cells - what''s new? • The new services • An introduction to In-Building solutions Design and IBwave tool • Case study • And what about LTE ?...

By alternating theory and practice, the trainees will be more focused, at the same time lowering the learning curve. The trainee will get the necessary background information for understanding a particular model or protocol first.  Secondly, the trainee learns how that model or protocol is implemented in the ISAM.  Finally the trainee configures the model or protocol using exercises.  CONTENTS  A. 7302-7360 ISAM The evolution of the access infrastructure is outlined, as well as how the ISAM fits in this evolution. The ISAM is shown in a typical access network and we take a look at the possible network topologies used.  The functional (hardware) architecture is described. As well the relationship between the functional blocks in terms of racks, shelves, and boards. The properties/characteristics of the FANT-F High Cap NT card are listed, as well as its architecture. In addition the Sync-E synchronization model is covered.  B. 5520 AMS  The AMS is described in terms of: - Where it is positioned in our network. - What type of nodes it manages. - Functions that are supported. - How it communicates with the nodes. - ISAM architecture. A demonstration is given to show basic AMS functionalities, ending with student practice.  C. Getting started Trainees start navigating the ISAM using the AMS. Also the ISAM''s craft interface (CLI) is demonstrated. Trainees have the choice to do the exercises based on AMS or CLI.  D. Basic configurations (incl. GPON technology) Trainees will learn how to configure the equipment (shelves, boards, up to the ONT/ONTCARD) as well as the Ethernet interfaces on the iHub. The trainees will learn how to work with profiles and templates.  They will learn the port types present in the ISAM and where to find all information, such as port operational status and administrative status. Through dedicated exercises the configuration will be setup in practice.  E. Use of L2 services and end-user setup Trainees will learn the L2 "service" concept on the iHUB as well as the L2 "VLAN" concept on the IACM. All L2 forwarding modes and features are explained, as well as how they are implemented and configured using the AMS. Covered forwarding models are: 1. L2: Intelligent Bridging 2. L2: Cross connect 3. L2+: Enhanced iBridge  F. Getting the ISAM supervised (turn-up procedure) Trainees will learn different management scenarios (such as inband and outband). The trainee executes the initial start-up procedure, so that the ISAM is reachable through IP as well as through SNMP.  The basic provisioning (equipment/ GPON port / ONT / services/etc.) is practiced.  G. Backup & restore of an ISAM The trainees will do a manual backup and restore of an ISAM. The automated backup concept will be explained and configured.  H. Fault management Trainees will be able to explain and work with fault management including: - The architecture of the alarm application - Alarm status / alarm synthesis - Current alarm list - Filtering out alarms for a single NE - Actions that can be triggered on an alarm - alarm details - Historical alarm lists  I. Software management (optional) Trainees will be able to explain the software concepts applicable to ISAM, and they will learn to: - Retrieve SW related info - Download SW to an NE - Test new SW on a board - Activate SW on a node - Remove obsolete SW  J. MSTP, LAG & NT redundancy How does the Spanning Tree Protocol work and how to configure? How can we aggregate multiple Ethernet links together into one logical link?     Audie','KILGORE, Doug','Beltran, Julien','2016-01-18 06:50:00','0','2017-02-03 18:20:55')

Mayer Managing Principal, LWS PS NPDIO Sandeep Distinguished Member of Consulting Staff, LWS PS NPDIO Kristen Lalor LWS Marketing Communications  Current telecommunication networks are going through tremendous changes on two fronts: mergers and technology changes.  Many mergers are happening now which affect wireline, wireless and data networks. To benefit from such mergers companies have to look at their existing networks and quickly consolidate the network into a single seamless network. A major benefit of the consolidation is to reduce OPEX by consolidating traffic to increase utilization and eliminate unneeded equipment and expenses.  As they merge and go towards a single network these companies can look at the next generation technology and move towards those technology options.   As Service Providers migrate to Next Generation networks they are further challenged to reduce legacy network OPEX to meet operating margin targets for combined network.     Three situations we particularly target for network consolidation optimization  are: Companies that have merged (wireless or wireline)  Companies that are seeing decreased traffic on their networks (i.e. most wireline companies in the U.S.) Companies that are migrating traffic from their legacy network to a next generation network   The LWS Network Planning, Design, Integration, and Optimization (NPDIO) organization has delivered numerous network consolidation / optimization analyses for wireless and wireline service providers and enterprises, for telephony and data networks, and we will share our experience and expertise from these actual customer analyses.  The session will cover market environment and drivers, the relevant LWS services portfolio, the Network Optimization Solution (value proposition, case studies, pull-through revenue, why Lucent), and selling tips.   Following the session, the participants will be able to describe whats driving Service Providers to optimize their consolidated networks, articulate the value of Network Consolidation Optimization Services, recognize Network Consolidation Optimization Services opportunities, successfully position and sell Network Consolidation Optimization Services, and identify equipment and services pull-through opportunities.

The problem is expecting otherwise and thinking that having problems is a problem.'' A problem is a question or situation that presents doubt, perplexity, or difficulty. It''s an issue that needs to be corrected or overcome in order to achieve a desired state. Problem solving involves goal-oriented thinking and action in situations for which no ready-made solutions exist.  Whether consciously or unconsciously, everybody solves problems relating to their personal or work life every day.

During this program you have learnt useful  skills and tips to develop professionally while remaining balanced between work  and home. This course aims to put your career in the fast lane by teaching you  to take control of your development, network effectively and identify and seize  opportunities. This course will give you the competitive advantage needed to  move up the corporate ladder.    Course Objectives  By the end of the course, participants will be able to:    Learn how to find the opportunities for their own development   How as you progress throughout your career   How to seize new opportunities when they come along   Learn from your colleagues   Know three attributes essential to career advancement            　   Course Contents  Unit 1 : Professor Jay Conger starts this course by stressing how every  manger and executive basically owns their own development. Many organizations  take too basic a view towards developing talent. Consequently, an individual  needs to take a proactive approach towards finding the opportunities for their  own development.    Unit 2 : In this lesson you hear a story from Amy Butte, former CFO of the New  York Stock Exchange, who found herself moving from one company to another  looking for one which fitted her. She teaches how as you progress throughout  your career it is important to set yourself a path with a clearly defined  target. Through successful networking Amy Butte found her fit and in this  section she shares her lesson to help you find your fit.    Unit 3: Today Sir George Cox puts career planning into perspective. He teaches  that no-one knows what life and its opportunities are going to hold in the  future. So just learn from what you''re doing, succeed at what you''re doing, and  seize new opportunities when they come along. 50 Lessons Plus shows you how to  seize opportunities by building on the skills learnt in the previous two  sections.    Unit 4: As you strive to get ahead, where better to seek opportunities and learn  from, than the business itself and the people working there. In today''s  lesson, Rosabeth Moss Kantor teaches you to not just wait for opportunities to  unfold in their career; the ambitious individuals are those that voraciously ask  questions and take a proactive interest in the wider business. Such curiosity  can bring valuable learning and opportunities.    Unit 5：In this course you have learnt key lessons in getting ahead in you  career. Today''s lesson sums up with Duina Dublon, Director at Microsoft,  Accenture & PepsiCo, advising you of three attributes essential to career  advancement. The need to be demanding of oneself, one''s boss and of the company;  having resilience, perseverance and the ability to focus on the final outcome;  and having a can-do attitude, the confidence to execute and the ability to  overcome obstacles.

Accept that everyone has their own limitations; you should avoid trying to mold  people to fit your needs.    If someone''s not a people person, don''t force them into a people-oriented role.    Don''t ignore the contribution that someone could make if they, at first, don''t  seem to fit in with the team.    Part 2 :    When you make a promise to employees, keep it. No exceptions.    Companies can proactively show their employees they care about them by creating  a culture of caring.    Businesses must demonstrate this culture of caring every day, regardless of how  tough times get.    During tough times, it''s imperative for businesses to stick to their promises,  which they can achieve by not wavering from their core values.    Although it may be financially formidable to do so, companies that take care of  their employees - who in turn take care of the customers - will be more  successful over the long haul.  　   Audience:  Managers and subordinates','CAI, Songwei','CAI, Songwei','2015-12-29 02:26:00','0','2017-02-03 18:23:34')

Key features for the MTAP Cloud and MTAP File Utility will be presented, explained, and demonstrated (as possible).  Some topics to cover include: • Extracting Speedtest summary images for ATP tests which utilized Viavi TrueSite Speedtest. • Cluster and In-Building testing can use a new Layer 3 message option to dump messages within 2 minutes on either side of critical events. • Improvements to large file upload for very large files, e.g. with Cluster/SSV. • Associated Project feature, where, for example, In-Building and SSD tests can produce output in multiple projects (with a quick report in one, and then a more detailed report in other) with the upload of one file. • Ability to search across multiple Projects at once - this is helpful with the Associated Project feature. • Option to specify cell icon size for maps. • A new Usage Report, so that leads and managers can run reports to see what files have been uploaded by whom, time to process, and other statistics. • For Web GUI upload, a link is provided to view the project configuration parameters.  In this way, Cluster/SSV and In-Building engineers can view the post-processing parameters to be used for the files that are currently being uploaded. • File Utility can bundle files from multiple TrueSite tests, for example when executing SSD tests across different sectors or bands where the files need to be combined for processing in the MTAP cloud. • And others.

The industry is now looking for closer integration (see Figure 1). Alcatel-Lucent is first to provide full standards-based SBC capabilities, completely integrated on the native IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) production platform: the Alcatel- Lucent 7510 Media Gateway (MGW), the Alcatel-Lucent 5450 Session Controller and the Alcatel-Lucent 5060 Session Controller. Built upon these field-proven assets, the Alcatel- Lucent Access and Interconnect Border provides a functionally and economically superior solution compared to the monolithic SBCs.

While 4G networks utilitze an efficient multiple access technique called OFDMA, OFDMA on its own cannot deliver the expected superior throughput in 4G systems.  Multiple antenna techniques play a critical role in increasing spectral efficiency.   This course provides fundamental knowledge of numerous multiple antenna techniques that will be an integral part of emerging radio access standards. Antenna basics are explained, along with  typical antenna configurations in commercial cellular deployments.  Major antenna techniques covered in this course include:  transmitter/receiver diversity techniques such as space-time coding (STC), beamforming techniques such as an adaptive beamforming system, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing techniques, and space/spatial division multiple access (SDMA).   This course was updated 4Q 2008!   Learning Objectives:    Outline key benefits and challenges of multiple antenna techniques.   Provide examples of various types of multiple antenna techniques.   Explain transmit and receive diversity techniques such as Space Time Coding and antenna grouping.   Contrast a switched-beam system with an adaptive beamforming technique.   Describe MIMO - spatial multiplexing techniques.   Discuss the implementation of SDMA.   Give examples of the multiple antenna techniques defined in emerging 4G cellular networks.  This e-course is developed by Award Solutions, Inc. and provided in collaboration with Alcatel-Lucent University.  Audience: This course is intended for those seeking a fundamental understanding of how various multiple antenna techniques work.  This includes those in a design, test, systems engineering, sales engineering, network engineering or verification roles.

Then it is  necessary to provide people with the requisite skills to bring about that change  themselves.    Quick Change－Not all organizational change must be slow and drawn out. Quick  and successful innovation is often underpinned by a brilliant team that not only  has the support of top management, but also believes in its own ability to  implement change quickly too.    Course Objectives  By the end of the course, participants will be able to know the importance of  driving change and quick change  Course Contents    Part 1:      People can be more easily persuaded to tackle things differently by their      peers rather than by senior managers.      Relating change to the goals of the organization encourages people to      understand why it is required.      There are two types of change: one relates to systems and operations; the      other is more complex and relates to how people think and act.      Show that change can be achieved, and that other people are doing it. Then      provide the skills to help people bring about that change themselves.   　    Part 2 :      At a fast-moving and dynamic organization, the speed of change can explode      the myth that change takes forever.      Top management support, resources and belief in a team''s ability to execute      ideas quickly and successfully will empower them to achieve just that.      Politics also plays a part in quick change. Teams in the organization need      to support each other to help achieve ambitious targets and avoid      territorial or introverted actions for personal benefit.      Companies can get dragged into the belief that change takes time and,      without realizing, never try to push the boundaries to produce quicker and      better results.
